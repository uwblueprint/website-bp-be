One of the many ways this can be done is through innovation and inspiration from those with the skills. This is exactly the opportunity Blueprint provides, which I'm more than eager to embark upon. I would also have the chance to be amongst like-minded peers that share a vision of the world, which would not only help me grow as a person, but make the projects that much more successful.

In terms of code difficulty, this project was not the most elaborate, but the reason why this has been my best project to date is because of the number of technologies we had to use and how well I was able to organize all of it together to make it work.
