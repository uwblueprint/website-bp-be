Using Python and data analysis tools, I created an algorithm to process NAV data and derive metrics like historical performance, return on investment, volatility, etc. These metrics enabled me to assess fund performance, risk levels, and cost-effectiveness, aiding informed investment decisions. Additionally, I incorporated data visualization techniques to present the metrics visually, facilitating easy comparison and identification of investment opportunities. Overall, this project effectively addressed the challenge, providing valuable insights within the constraints of limited data, and empowering me to make informed investment choices.",

In this method, let we have my app Support Bud, we can first create an initial prototype, write your own assumptions, and other users' assumptions for it, eg. Assumption 1: there are very limited functions in the app which does not satisfy the problem statement. Then we can experiment on the users, since its is a small scale project as of now we can go ahead with a few user interviews and survey forms, in its next version for catering a wider audience we can move to survey forms and support groups. \nwe can then choose a metric and see if our assumptions are true. Most likely, what we assume is only half true. Thus the experimentation is important."

If I find that I am not able to handle a particular task properly, eg. at one I was not able to manage my mails properly, so I discussed this with coworker who could do that well and he helped me with tips and techniques to sort my mailbox.

More often than not, people who have skin diseases, weight problems, physical disabilities etc. are treated differently, which indirectly affects their mental health. This can especially have a damaging affect on young adults. This cause resonates with me because I have been dealing with psoriasis (an autoimmune skin disorder) since the past 10 years and thus want to extend the community to help others dealing with it too."

We help each other by motivating others through posts and lending a helping hand to people in distress. But most importantly, it is by creating awareness among people who do not know about this condition.\nEnvision being the first person on the planet to wear glasses, now imagine us wearing them in a variety \nof styles and colours at this moment. The pair of glasses remains the same, but what has \nchanged is our vision. This is what I aim to achieve with people having chronic illnesses and I feel this can be changed using design thinking. \nDealing with this illness myself, I have seen that while there is contact information, \nsupport groups, and physicians around, it could still be challenging to connect with ideal people \nwho are going through a similar experience as we are. This sparked an idea for a prototype,\nSupport Bud which deals with this issue."

While learning singing I realized that there is no limit in learning music, or rather no limit to learning anything. In the beginning, I was trying to get into the technicalities and thought that once I learn this I will be done. Later on, I realized that this approach won't work as you cannot get good by just knowing stuff. I practiced it everyday, and day by day I could feel the difference. Today its been more than 5 years, but still I feel there is a long way to go, but now I don't mind because I enjoy singing everyday!"
